# About

Libre is simple app developed in Rails 5 for educational purposes.


# Getting started

If you want to run Libre on your local machine, make sure you have correctly installed Rails and then run following commands:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ahawrylak/libre.git
```

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be able to run the app in local server (localhost:3000 by default)

```
$ rails server
```
